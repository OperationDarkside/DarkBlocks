# DarkBlocks

Minecraft-inspired open world sandbox game.

- Pure C++ for max performance
- OpenGL to be cross platform
- Learning by doing (due to my inexperience)

## History

I like Minecraft. Its concept is fascinating and the amount of mods represent the potential it has as a platform. 
Since I started programming, I wanted to create a game. And after learning programming for several years now, I feel
confident enough to do it on my own. This, however, is not the first try. With the name "DarkBlocksX" I tried to
create a Minecraft-Clone with Unreal Engine 4. But the horrible documentation, the massive use of macros (because of legacy)
and their annoying way of pushing Blueprint (their visual scripting language as C++ replacement) made me giving up on that one.
Hopsons Minecraft-Clone doesn't have the motivation to add a lot more features than it had after one week. I even 
tried to contribute to it (modification of the blocktype system, to make it mod-able), but it was not considered neccessary.

So I'm gonna make my own Minecraft-Clone. With BlackJack and Hookers.

## Other Projects

Projects like MineTest and Hopsons Minecraft-one-week-challenge are proof that there is interest and motivation for open source 
alternatives. But all of the projects known to me have some flaws. MineTest considers itself more as a platform for more options.
It uses Lua as a programming language to implement the actual game. Although Lua is considered to be fast, its lack of OOP
and the fact, that it's a scripting language, doesn't give me the impression you could the the max performance out of it. 
Hopsons Minecraft-Clone is exactly what it says it is. A game that was written in a week , although continued due to popularity, 
but not the full feature set of Minecraft.
